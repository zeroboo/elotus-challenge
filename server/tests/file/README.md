# Test Files

This directory contains test files used by the upload tests.

## Files

- `leaf.png` - A minimal 1x1 pixel PNG image used for testing file upload functionality
  - Auto-generated by the test if it doesn't exist
  - Contains a valid PNG header and minimal image data
  - Used in `TestHandleUpload_ValidImageFile_Success`

## Usage

The test files are automatically created when tests run if they don't exist. The `loadOrCreateTestPNG()` function in the upload tests will:

1. Try to load the existing PNG file
2. Verify it has a valid PNG signature 
3. Create a new minimal PNG file if needed

This ensures tests can run reliably without requiring manual setup of test files.
